# hello-fuzzy-disco-world

What one would say if one lived in a "fuzzy disco world" and were so inclined to greet said world in a generally positive manner. 

Let's pretend this is a fuzzy disco world: Hi, kelvintemp here. Just another Terran weirdo. 

I prefer Terra to Earth for the name of the planet we live on. I just do. Maybe it's all that CAPTAIN FUTURE and HARLOCK I watched as a kid, but yeah. 

Also, while I've got your attention, let me remind you that tacos are almost always superior to sandwiches. I mean, sandiwches are fine for the most part, but tacos are more than capable of filling that 'hand-food' gap.

So I guess I like tacos. And prefer Terra/Terran to Earth/Earthling. And if I lived in space (like, say, the asteroid belt, or in the orbital embrace of one of our solar system's gas giants) I'd probably call Terrans "Dirtsiders".
